# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Salary-hike-data-set
•	As there are 2 columns  hence I used Simple linear regression model 
•	Considered  Independent column (X)as YearsExperience
•	Considered  dependent column as(Y) Salary
•	Using sklearn.model_Selection& Train_Test_Split function 
•	Spited the X and y column between  X_train , Y_train & X_test , y_test
•	Assigned 40% of data for test data
•	Assigned 60% of data for train data
•	Fit the x train and y train data into Linear Regression formula 
•	Once train data gets fit into Linear Regression formula
-	Will check predicted value of Y using x test data
-	Once we receive Y predicted value 
-	will check with Y test data  to check Accuracy of model
